**Optional goals**

**Rank 2**: If you have **two or more letters with the same frequency**, 
then return the letter which comes first in the alphabet. 
For example -- "one" contains "o", "n", "e" only once for each and since it comes first, we choose "e".

**Rank 3**: If the second argument "all_letters" is True, 
then your function should return all letters from the text in lowercase as a string.
Letters must be sorted in descending order by frequency and same frequency letters by alphabetical order.
For example -- "Hello" => "leho". "l" is the first because appears twice and
other letters are sorted by alphabet.

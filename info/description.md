You are given a text, which contains different English letters and punctuation symbols. 
You must find the most frequent letter in the given text. The letter returned must be in lower case.

While checking for the most wanted letter, casing does not matter, so for the purpose of your search, 
"A"=="a". Make sure you do not count punctuation symbols, digits and white spaces, only letters.

If you have **two or more letters with the same frequency**, then return the letter which comes first in the alphabet. 
For example -- "one" contains "o", "n", "e" only once for each and since it comes first, we choose "e".
